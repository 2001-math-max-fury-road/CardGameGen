# Resources Used:
- We drew inspiration from the Netflix Party Chrome extension (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/netflix-party/oocalimimngaihdkbihfgmpkcpnmlaoa?hl=en) and looked at the source code (https://github.com/netflixparty1/netflixparty-chrome) to help us get started.

- We watched this tutorial on integrating socket.io into a Chrome extension (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zVoGTQUXvs) and referenced the corresponding repo (https://github.com/matthewlawson/lnm-socket.io)
